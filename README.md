Rest Resources
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All REST resources support GET,POST,PUT and DELETE methods. To retrieve 
a resource by id do: 

    METHOD /api/api/resource_name_here/id/{the resource id}

For example to retrieve a county with id of 1:

    GET /api/api/county/id/1

All REST objects also support collections by querying with the following
convention.

    GET /api/api/resource_name_here/

To create or update resources use POST to create and PUT to update. Use
JSON to create the form data. For example, to create a County:

    POST /api/api/county/
    { 
        "name" : "Test Name"
    }
