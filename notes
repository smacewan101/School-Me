- Whats the purpose of our app? 
-- Making it easier to decide where you or your family should get an
education in vermont. 

- How did we try to do it?
-- Tried to do it in a visually intuitive way. 

- The data sets.
-- We had report data sets and csv and excel files. As well as HTML
parsing. Enrollment information. Teacher-student ratios. drop out rates.
NECAP test results. 

- Tried to display pertenant data: Necap scores. Compare schools within
  a county, view reports at a county level to narrow a search down.

- RESTful backend for easy access by other projects wanting to make use
  of the data we have. 

- Color scheme is all vermont! Because it's a vermont app and not only
  seeks to help vermonters, but others who want to come to vermont. 

- Problems:
-- The internet. Cutting out prevented us from pushing neccesary goods to
each other 

- Tech: 
-- php framework called dinkly. jQuery. perl for scraping. mySQL.
